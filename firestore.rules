/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by default, restricting access unless explicitly allowed.
 * It is designed for rapid prototyping and assumes minimal data validation.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of two top-level collections: `contactFormSubmissions` and `products`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 * - The structure provides authorization independence because there are no hierarchical dependencies; each collection can be secured independently.
 *
 * Access Control Patterns:
 * - `/contactFormSubmissions`: Publicly readable, but only authenticated users can create submissions. Updates and deletes are disallowed.
 * - `/products`: Publicly readable. Only authenticated users can create product listings. Updates and deletes are disallowed.
